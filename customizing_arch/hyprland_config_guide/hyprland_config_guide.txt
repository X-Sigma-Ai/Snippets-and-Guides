!! Looking like a hacker is more important than actually being one. For that, you need to have tiling windows!!

run:
pacman -Qs hyprland
	to see if you have hyprland installed. Output shoould show a local/hyprland stuff. 

if not then run:
	sudo pacman -S hyprland xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland xdg-desktop-portal wl-clipboard
-----
systemctl status display-manager
	run this to see if you have a display manager and what it is. then you are to log out of it. 
	i have GNOME so my command is:
gnome-session-quit --logout --no-prompt

------------------------
when you login there is a gear by the bottom right,. this is where youy can choose hyprland desktop. 
SUPER = windows key. Press SUPER and Q to open kitty. 
edit: SUPER Q is ONLY FOR THE FIRST TIME. IT IS NOT A COMMAND TO OPEN KITTY. It means killactive
----------------------

INSTALL AND COPY OVER THE DIRECTORY TO THE CONFIG FOLDER: 
1. Find system default		find /usr -name APPNAME.conf 2>/dev/null
2. Create config folder		mkdir -p ~/.config/APPNAME
3. Copy config in place		cp /usr/share/...    ~/.config/APPNAME/.conf
4. Edit config			nano ~/.config/APPNAME/.conf

find /usr -name hypr.conf 2>/dev/null // to find the folder you need to copy
mkdir -p ~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf  // to make the folder for your configs
cp /usr/share/hypr/hyprland.conf ~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf // copy over the stuff to your folder
nano ~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf  // use nana to open this config folder.

TO DO: Learn how to write script to do this 	
-------------------------

get an app launcher:
sudo pacman -S wofi
//wofi is native with wayland and hyprland
-----------------------------------
WARNING: SUPER Q is KILL ACTIVE. if you press it with a barebones hyprland you close the terminal
and there is nothing you can do...need to initial a shortcut key to open kitty. 
------------------------------------
in the config file:
~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf

if you look up bind this is the keybind combos and this is where you can set up
for SUPER and Enter to open Kitty:
bind = $mainMod, RETURN, exec, kitty
--------------------------------------
key binds to know by default in hypr:
	
	SUPER X = Kills the window you're on
		(Used to be C but you close nano with x so )
	SUPER ESCAPE = Exits  the whole hyperland session
		(Used to be M, but Im gonna make it ESCAPE cuz thats more drastic)
	SUPER O = Opens your filemanager (default is dolphin, gonna use thundar later)
		(Used to be E, but Im gonna make it O cuz it makes sense)
	SUPER V = Makes the window floating like how Windows has it
	SUPER P = Makes the window tile Psuedo while you can freely resize
	SUPER R = Opens the app launcher wofi
	SUPER L = Changes if new window opens vertical or horizontal. 
		(Used to be SUPER J, but Changed it to SUPER L so it feels just like kitty 
		has the togglesplit option as CTRL SHIFT L)
----------------------------------------------------------------
WAYBAR

Hyprland has an AUTOSTART and likes waybar as a statusbar menu so lets use it
run:
sudo pacman -S waybar 
//waybar needs a special font so grab that too:

run:
sudo pacman -S ttf-font-awesome
// this gives us nice icons for our status bar holy shit

//set WAYBAR to open when HYPRLAND starts, go to hypr/conf and write or uncomment this:
exec-once = waybar


TO DO: learn how to get waybar configs from github later so i can have a config/waybar 
defaulty config. Don't have Internet browser at the moment, will get later, Gotta delete the sway stuff
in the module and put in hyprland stuff
-----------------------------------------------------------------
LIBREWOLF

I need a browser on this laptop. for Librewolf you need its own special pacman/winget called
Flatpak. Something about updates and sandboxed lingo I dont understand yet. Librewolf is for
security and it needs to be up to date automatically. though this breaks the arch rule of 
"do it yourself always" you can't take that risk with somethign thats supposed to represent security
for this reason it has its own special pacman i think
 run:

sudo pacman -S flatpak

// then add the repo, i guess so it knows to do its own updates later

sudo flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo

then install the flatpak version of librewolf with:
flatpak install flathub io.gitlab.librewolf-community

RECOMMENDED TO PUT KEYBIND
	SUPER B = opens librewolf browser 
put this in the hypr.conf:
bind = $mainMod, B, exec, flatpak run io.gitlab.librewolf-community

-----------------------------------------------------------------
WARNING: THINGS MIGHT FREEZE ON FIRST INITIALIZATION. This is the Linux way, apparently.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
BITWARDEN

OOF---Librewolf does not remember login or password. I guess this is an obvious duh since it is so focused
on no tracking or telemetry stuff. We need a password manager. Time for Bitwarden.

run: 
flatpak install flathub com.bitwarden.desktop

launch this and make an account:
flatpak run com.bitwarden.desktop

Click on add new item and select Login, enter your username and pw and then the site that is for this pw. 

----------------------------------------------------

//open librewolf which is just firefox in disguise it seems. seach extensions, look up bitwarden, 
install it. then open the bitwarden ext in firefox and password and its done. from here on out anytime
you visit a site that you gave the pw to bit warden for, you have to click bit and have him autofill
manual click is needed. no more auto login and saved passwords. the price for security is heavy indeed.
