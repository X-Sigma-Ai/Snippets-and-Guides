MAKE KITTY PRETTY 

most kitty terminals are new and updaetd and have file open functions.
mine does so i need to do it from scratch. '

sudo find /usr -iname '*kitty*'
	do a search for everything with kitty. we are trying to find
	usr.share........kitty.conf file. when you do that command
	all things will show up. you have to now copy it and paste it in 
	a directory. 


======================================================

cp /usr/share/.../kitty.conf   ~/.config/kitty/kitty.conf
	linux dont have ctrl c or right click. gotta do cp, path and then type the 
	new path. now use nano to open the file by running

nano ~/.config/kitty/kitty.conf
	A whole lotta stuff will be here, you can delete the hastags or make modifications here,

	if the thing you modify has a # in front of it, be sure to remove it. 
	when you make a change in kitty press Ctrl+O to write and then
	hard reload run:
kill -SIGUSR1 $(pidof kitty)
======================================

KITTY COMMANDS:

Ctrl+Shift+Enter opens a new split terminal
CTR + L changes how the new terminal opens
CTR + Shift + W close the terminal you are focused in

// to have Split window navigation put this in the kitty.conf file
map ctrl+shift+right next_window
map ctrl+shift+left previous_window
map ctrl+shift+up next_window
