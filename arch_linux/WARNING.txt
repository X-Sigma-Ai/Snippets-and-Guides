Dear Diary,
I spent 11 hours walking through the arch wiki to install Arch Linux on a laptop with no ethernet port,
now I need to start over and make sure to send over the NetworkManager from the USB. I then learned about 
the simple command called archinstall, and I lost a few hairs on my head. 

WARNING!!!

1.  MAKE SURE NEW DEVICE HAS ETHERNET PORT, OTHERWISE INSTALL NETWORK MANAGER FROM USB !!
2. DO NOT USE 2GB USB, AT LEAST 4GB AS THE LIVE USB.
