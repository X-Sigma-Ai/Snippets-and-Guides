Dear Diary,
I spent 11 hours walking through the arch wiki to install Arch Linux on a laptop with no ethernet port,
now I need to start over and make sure to send over the NetworkManager from the USB. I then learned about 
the simple command called archinstall, and I lost a few hairs on my head. 

WARNING!!!

!!   MAKE SURE NEW DEVICE HAS ETHERNET PORT, OTHERWISE INSTALL NETWORK MANAGER FROM USB !!
