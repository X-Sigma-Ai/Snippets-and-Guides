//I fear a broken install and being lonely without packages,
//Most stuff here is for flutter dev and hyprland stuff. 
//not needed but just for paranoia.

//Welcome to the Linux Experience.

		(Choose Save all and then type where you want to save it. /root/ is fine)

Hit Install

//you will be asked to use the configs json, say yes.


Magic will happen on screen then you will be asked if you want to chrroot into the newlay created install.
say yes. 

when you see [root@archiso /]# run:

exit
umount -R /mnt
reboot
// as soon as black screen â†’ unplug USB
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------
if all things go well it shoudl run and ask you for your login and password.

activate the network manager by running:
sudo systemctl start NetworkManager
and enter your password.


After the first boot in, the system might freeze cuz all the stuff is setting up. after the first reboot all things should be good. 
DONT FEAR THE FREEZE!!


!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
FOR SOME REASON THERE IS NO PACMAN IN THIS INSTALL AND NOTHING MAKES SENSE. 
open terminal and run this to install pacman, even though it should have been here wtf

curl -O https://america.mirror.pkgbuild.com/core/os/x86_64/pacman-6.0.2-7-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst
// this will download the zipped file

unzstd pacman-6.0.2-7-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst
// this will unzip it

sudo tar -xvpf pacman-6.0.2-7-x86_64.pkg.tar -C /
// this will install it. 

---------------------------------

THIS IS BAREBONES AND NOTHING IS INITIALIZED WTF!!
